              <p class="mt-4" id="view">
                To use the Reduction Toolkit you must first login using your
                username and password. If you are a Director of Materials
                Management (DMM) with BHS, you will be given a username and
                password that will enable you to act on behalf of your facility.
                If you are a DMM and do not know your login credentials, please
                contact jdprice@baptisthealthsystem.com
              </p>

              <p>
                The Reduction Toolkit is made up of four separate "tools" or
                sections:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Action Profile</li>
                <li>Target Non Intake Items</li>
                <li>Target Intake Items</li>
                <li>Review Targeted Items</li>
              </ol>

              <p id="actionprofile">
                We will now be taking an in-depth look at each one of these
                sections. Note that you can jump ahead to any section you are
                interested in by clicking the hyperlinks on the left side of the
                documentation.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step Two: View Page -->
            <div>
              <h3 class="mt-4">Step Two: The Action Profile</h3>
              <p class="mt-4">
                After logging in, you will be redirected to the Action Profile
                page. You can think of this page as your HQ for making all
                decisions related to incoming or outgoing inventory. Below
                you'll see a screenshot of an example Action Profile. You will
                notice that the profile consists of a header at the top of the
                screen with several metrics in a list, and two tables below
                that. These features will be explained over the next several
                steps. On the left is the navigation drawer that you can use to
                navigate the website. Remember that you can always get back to
                the documentation by clicking the tab labeled "Documentation" if
                you are ever stuck or confused.
              </p>

              <p>
                NOTE: Portions of screengrabs in the documentation have been
                redacted to protect sensitive company information.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/ActionProfileDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4" id="target">
                Now that your're familiar with the layout of the website, it's
                time to focus on targeting items for reduction. The Reduction
                Toolkit (RT) takes your inventory counts submitted bi-annually
                and pulls the items located in your Surgery and Cath Lab (SLB
                and NCB are solely items located in surgery). These items are
                then
                <b>sorted for highest Extended Cost (LUOM Price * Quantity)</b>
                and then seperated into two buckets.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Top 100 Items by Ext Cost that <b>did not</b> receive intake
                  in FY2020
                </li>
                <li>
                  Top 100 Items by Ext Cost that <b>did</b> receive intake in
                  FY2020
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p id="targetitems">
                Therefore you have two options when targeting items that you'd
                like to reduce. You can target "No Intake Items", or you can
                target "Intake Items" (AKA items that are seeing intake but we
                might consider being held in excess). Your first priority should
                be to target and reduce inventory that is not seeing intake, so
                let's do that in the next step.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step Three: Target No Intake -->
            <div>
              <h3 class="mt-4">Step Three: Target Items for Reduction</h3>

              <p class="mt-4">
                Still on the Action Profile page, you can navigate to the Target
                No Intake page by clicking the tab on the navigation sidedrawer
                labeled "Target No Intake". This will take you to a screen with
                a list of items being considered "Non-Intake" items. The list
                consists of 100 items that are flagged as no intake and are
                sorted by highest extended cost. In order for an item to be
                considered to have no intake it must meet the following
                requirements:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Zero purchase orders (POs) for FY2020 (source data from Novus
                  Reach)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Zero items issued to your facility (issues) for FY2020 (I9000
                  report from IMMS)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Note that if an item is in multiple locations or "bins" in your
                facility, then the system will group them together if their unit
                of measures (UOM) are the same. This helps to handle items with
                the same IMMS number that are listed multiple times on your
                count sheet.
              </p>

              <p>Below is what the Target No Intake page should look like:</p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/NoIntakeItemsDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Now that you've got your list of items with no intake, you can
                begin targeting them. Each DMM should go through their list and
                check to see if any of the items in the list can be reduced at
                their facility. For our example, let's say that you are checking
                the list and see that the item in the screenshot above labeled
                "RELOAD, STAPLE ARTICULATING..." can be reduced. You would then
                click the checkbox in the item's card labeled "Target Item".
                After checking the box, the box will have a blue checkmark in it
                and the system will update automatically. We don't have to click
                anything after checking the box, the system saves automatically
                and we can continue on in the process.
              </p>

              <p id="reviewtargets">
                After going through the list and selecting all of the items that
                you'd like to reduce from your facility, you can then click on
                the tab labeled "Review Targets" in your navigation sidedrawer
                on the left of your page.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step Four: Review Targets -->
            <div>
              <h3 class="mt-4">Step Four: Review Targets</h3>
              <p>
                After clicking on the "Review Targets" tab, you should now be
                looking at a page with the title "Review Target Items" at the
                top of screen. See below:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/ReviewTargetItems.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                You'll see the item that you targeted previously, as well as any
                other items that you have targeted.
              </p>

              <p>
                When you want to reduce an item, you will need to submit what is
                called a "movement plan". A movement plan will help you keep
                track of an item during the reduction process and also measure
                how much inventory you have reduced over a given period.
              </p>

              <p>
                To submit a movement plan, click the blue button labeled "Set
                Movement Plan" on the bottom of the item's card.
              </p>

              <p>
                You will now be taken to the page where you can submit your
                movement plan. You'll see three sections of information on this
                page:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Item Information</li>
                <li>BHS Intake and Inventory History</li>
                <li>Tenet Purchase Order History</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The first section under the title "Set Movement Plan for Item:"
                is listing out the pertinent information for the item you have
                selected. Which will include Mfr Cat No, IMMS #, and unit of
                measure information.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/SetMovePlan1.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                The second section is under the title "BHS Facilities Showing
                Inventory History or Intake History". It's listing facilities
                within Baptist Health System that have shown the selected item
                in their most recent submitted inventory count. Note that even
                if the facility had zero units in their inventory, they will
                still show up if they've had the imms number in their count at
                some point, as we can see with facility 939 (BMC). Also worth
                noting, all measures mentioned above are shown in their lowest
                unit of measure. You can confirm this by referencing the UOM
                information given at the top of this page.
              </p>

              <p>
                The third section is under the label "Tenet Facilities Showing
                Purchase Order History" (pictured below). This section will show
                you if any facilities within Tenet have a made purchase order
                for the selected item in FY2020. In our example, you can see
                that Abrazo Arrowhead Campus is showing the highest units
                ordered last year. It is worth noting that all markets in Tenet
                are represented except for the Detroit Market. We are still
                working on integrating their Lawson system with IMMS.
              </p>

              <img

                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Also note that you can download the DMM contact list by clicking
                the gray outline button labeled "Download Tenet DMM Contact
                Info". The contact sheet is accurate as of 3/1/2021 and includes
                email/phone info for all DMM's in Tenet.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/SetMovePlan3.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Finally, we arrive to the bottom of the page, the Movement Plan
                Form (pictured above). You should see a form with three fields:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Quantity</li>
                <li>Decision</li>
                <li>System Destination Facility</li>
              </ol>

              <h5>Quantity</h5>
              <p>
                The quantity field is asking how many units of the selected item
                you are seeking to reduce from your quantity. Again, these units
                are in lowest unit of measure. You will be required to enter an
                intenger into this field that is higher than 0 and lower than
                your current inventory quantity which is listed in the item
                information at the top of the page. If you accidentally enter a
                quantity greater than your inventory level you will be shown an
                error page that will instruct you to try again or reference the
                documentation. Note that the Reduction Toolkit lets you set
                multiple Movement Plans on a single item. In order to prevent
                users from overdrafting their stocked inventory, the application
                will throw the aforementioned error page if a user makes
                multiple requests whose cumulative quantity is greater than
                facilities' inventory.
              </p>

              <h5>Decision</h5>
              <p>
                The decision is which method you would like to use to reduce the
                item's inventory. You have four options to choose from and they
                are listed in descending order of most optimal outcome to least
                optimal outcome:
              </p>

              <p><b>Ship to a facility within the system</b></p>
              <p class="ml-4">
                Choose this option if there is a BHS facility that is showing
                large intake of the selected item. This should be your first
                priority if possible.
              </p>

              <p><b>Ship to a Tenet Facility</b></p>
              <p class="ml-4">
                Choose this option if there is a Tenet facility that is showing
                large intake of the selected item. This should be your second
                priority if possible.
              </p>

              <p><b>Sell to a Third Party Vendor</b></p>
              <p class="ml-4">
                Choose this option if there is not enough intake in any BHS
                facilities or Tenet facilities. This should be your third
                choice.
              </p>

              <p><b>Discard the Item</b></p>
              <p class="ml-4">
                Choose this option if you have exhausted all other options. This
                should be your last resort.
              </p>

              <h5>System Destination Facility</h5>
              <p>
                After making a decision, the final field will be system
                destination facility. This field is potentially tricky and may
                lead to errors if not handled correctly. Its purpose is to help
                facilitate transfers within the Baptist Health System by
                declaring which facility you are attempting to transfer to. For
                example, our item is showing significant intake in BHS at
                Northeast Baptist. Knowing that, we would want to identify NBH
                as our destination facility by clicking the dropdown menu and
                selecting "Northeast Baptist Hospital".
              </p>

              <p>
                But what if you are <b>not</b>
                shipping the item within BHS you might ask? Because this field
                cannot be left blank we need to indicate that we are not
                shipping within the system and are either shipping to a Tenet
                facility or selling/discarding the item. We can do this by
                clicking the dropdown and selecting "Shipping to a Tenet
                Facility" if we are sending to a Tenet facility or we can select
                "Selling or Discarding" if we are selling the item or discarding
                it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you have filled out all the fields you can press the blue
                button labeled "Submit" to submit the form. For our example,
                let's say that you want to sell 5 EA of this item. To do so, you
                would enter 5 in the quantity field, select the radio button
                labeled "Sell to a third party vendor" and the select "Selling
                or Discarding" in the System Destination Facility dropdown. You
                can then click the submit button to submit the form.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/FormSubmitDocs.png"

                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Once you've submitted the form, you will taken back to the
                review targets page. You'll now be able to see that there is a
                "1" next to section of the card labeled "Plans Set".
              </p>

              <img

                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p id="movementplans" class="mt-4">
                Remember that you can set multiple movement plans on a single
                item. While the "Plans Set" counter will show you how many plans
                you have submitted for a single item, you can click on the gray
                "See All Plans" button on the bottom of the item card to get a
                detailed breakout of the plans.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the next section, let's talk more about movement plans and
                what we can do with them after creating them.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step Five: Movement Plans -->
            <div>
              <h3 class="mt-4">Step Five: Movement Plans</h3>

              <p>
                Now that you've created your first movement plan, let's look
                more at how we can manage them in the Action Profile page. Click
                the tab labeled "Action Profile" in the navigation sidedrawer to
                be taken to your profile.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first thing you'll notice is that two parts of the profile
                have changed:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/PostSubmittedAP.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                First, you'll see that in the upper righthand side of the page,
                the metric labeled "You have targeted $_____ of inventory" has
                updated to reflect the new item that you just targeted. The
                metric is blue because it also serves as a link which you can
                click on to get a detailed breakout of the items that you have
                targeted.
              </p>

              <h5>Editing Movement Plans</h5>
              <p>
                Second, you'll notice that there is a new movement plan in your
                table at the bottom of the screen labeled "My Outgoing
                Requests". This is the movement plan you just submitted to
                reduce by selling 5 EA units. If you need to change the amount
                you'd like to reduce then you can do so by clicking the yellow
                button with the pencil icon on the righthand side of the page.
                If you need to change your decision to sell the item to
                discarding or transfering it instead, you will need to delete
                the item by clicking the red trashcan icon and submitting a new
                plan.
              </p>

              <h5>Finalizing Movement Plans</h5>
              <p>
                You'll notice that the status associated with this plan is
                currently "outstanding". Plans that are transfers to Tenet
                facilities, selling or discarding, will be considered
                "outstanding" until you finalize them by clicking the button
                labeled "Finalize".
                <mark
                  >It is important to note that you should not finalize the
                  movement plan until you have physically removed the item from
                  your facility.</mark
                >
                In our example, this would look like reaching out to a third
                party vendor, receiving a quote, receiving approval from your
                CFO, and then physically shipping the item to the third party
                vendor. Once that has been accomplished you will click the
                Finalize button to indicate that you have completed the
                reduction of the item.
              </p>

              <p>
                After finalizing the movement plan, you will notice several
                things happen:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/RemovedInventory.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                First of all, you can see that you no longer have that item
                queued up in your "Outgoing Requests" table. Second, you will
                see that the item was removed from your targeted metric in the
                top righthand side of the page. The ext cost was removed and was
                added to the metric labeled "You have removed $____ of
                inventory". Notice that this metric also allows you to click on
                it and be shown a breakout of the items that are making up your
                completed movement plans. After clicking on the metric you will
                also notice that you can export the table of completed plans out
                to an Excel Spreadsheet. This should be helpful in notifiying
                accounting of the changes that you have made.
              </p>

              <p>
                That's not the only place the application is updating after
                completing a movement plan. By clicking on the "Review Targets"
                tab in the navigation sidedrawer you will see that the field
                labeled "Remaining Quantity" in the item card has been reduced
                by 5 EA units.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/UpdatedReviewTargetItems.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <h5 class="mt-4">
                Hiding a Targeted Item When You are Done With It
              </h5>
              <p>
                The entire application has updated to reflect your changes. You
                are free to set as many movement plans as your inventory will
                allow. When you are satisfied with the level of inventory that
                the item is now set at, you can hide an item from your "Review
                Targets" list by clicking the blue "X" in the top righthand side
                of the item's card. This will help you keep your targeted items
                list from getting cluttered with items that you are through
                targeting. It will also help you work through your "No Intake"
                and "High Ext" lists while keeping things nice and organized.
              </p>

              <h5>Conclusion</h5>
              <p id="bhsmovementplans">
                That brings the current tutorial to a close. That is essentially
                everything you would need to know for targeting an item, setting
                a movement plan, and finalizing it once you have completed the
                reduction. One last thing I would like to cover though is how
                transfers work within the Baptist Health System. We've covered
                reduction through transfers to Tenet facilities, selling, and
                discarding items, but now I'd like to focus on transferring an
                item from one facility within BHS to another. These movement
                plans work slightly different than movement plans that are
                directed towards Tenet facilities or selling/discarding. The
                reason they are different is they allow one DMM to respond to a
                movement plan set by another. Let's take a deeper look into how
                that might work.
              </p>

              <h3>Step Six: Transferring Items within BHS</h3>

              <p class="mt-4">
                Let's look at another example, but this time let's target an
                "Intake" item instead of a "No Intake" item. We are also going
                to transfer it within BHS instead of selling it to a third party
                vendor.
              </p>

              <p>
                The process for targeting intake items is exactly the same as it
                is for targeting no intake items. You begin by clicking the tab
                in the navigation sidedrawer labeled "Target Intake". After
                arriving to the page, you can go down the list, one by one, or
                if you have a specific item or type of item you are looking for
                you can search for it in the filter box. There's a certain IMMS
                # I have in mind, so I am going to enter it in the field under
                the label "Imms contains" and then press the blue "Filter"
                button. See below:
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that these screenshots have been altered to redact
                sensitive information.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/TargetIntake.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                You'll target the item by checking the box labeled "Target Item"
                at the bottom of the item card. After doing this, you will click
                the tab in the navigation sidedrawer labeled "Review Targets" to
                see the item you just targeted. Again, this is the same process
                as Targeting No Intake items.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/ReviewTargetItemsIntake.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <h5 class="mt-4">Set the Movement Plan</h5>
              <p>
                Once on the "Review Targets" page, click the blue button labeled
                "Set Movement Plan" on the item you just targeted. You will then
                be taken to the set movement plan form.
              </p>

              <p>
                You will then be taken the movement plan form where you will
                make your decision on how you want to reduce this item. For our
                example, let's pretend you are the DMM at facility 954. We will
                call you DMM A. You are looking for a facility to send this item
                to within the BHS system. By looking at the movement history
                below you can see that facility 939 showed the greatest intake
                for the BHS system last year. Knowing that, you should try and
                send the excess inventory to the DMM at facility 939, let's call
                them DMM B.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/MovementPlanIntake1.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Maybe you want to send DMM B two boxes of this item (LUOM 24
                EA). The movement plan form you would submit for that scenario
                would look like this:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/MovementPlanIntake2.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Here you are sending a request to DMM B that you would like to
                send them 24 EA of the item. Click submit to send the form and
                be taken back to the review targets page.
              </p>

              <p class="mt-4">
                You'll see that the movement plan has been recorded for the
                item, as the "Plans Set" counter now shows 1. Click the tab
                labeled "Action Profile" on the navigation sidedrawer to be
                taken back to your profile.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once on your Action Profile page, you will see the new movement
                plan under your table labeled "My Outgoing Requests". See below:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/IntakeSubmittedAP.png"

                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <h5 class="mt-4">Responding to BHS System Requests</h5>

              <p>
                We are close to removing this item, but are still waiting to
                finalize it. As mentioned before, finalizing the movement plan
                to facility 939 will work slightly different because it is a
                movement plan within the BHS system. If you were to try and
                click that movement plan's Finalize Button right now, it would
                not work because the movement request still has a status of
                "outstanding".
                <mark>
                  You will not be able to finalize a BHS system movement plan
                  until the DMM of that facility approves your request.
                </mark>
                If you were to look at the Action Profile of the DMM at facility
                939, their table labeled "My Incoming Requests" would look like
                this:
              </p>

                You'll see that your request has populated their table and is
                waiting for their respone. They have two options they can use to
                respond, "Approve" or "Reject", and these are chosen by picking
                their respective buttons on the righthand side of the movement
                plan. If the DMM at facility 939 decides to accept the movement
                plan, they will need to enter the number of units into the field
                labeled "Accept Qty". Note that this figure will be in lowest
                unit of measure already for you.
              </p>

              <p>
                For our example, let's say that the DMM at facility 939 decides
                that they can take on only 20 units instead of the full 24. They
                would then enter four in the "Accept Qty" field and would then
                press the green "Accept" button. You may be expecting the metric
                in the top righthand side of the page labeled "You have accepted
                $___ of inventory" to update and reflect the inventory that the
                DMM has just accepted, but that will not happen. This movement
                plan still needs to be finalized by the sending DMM for it to be
                recognized by the application. Let's do that next
              </p>

              <h5>Finalizing the Movement Plan</h5>
              <p>
                Back on the Action Profile for the sending DMM at facility 954,
                you can see that the DMM at facility 939 accepted the movement
                plan you sent them. You can see this by the "accepted" label in
                the "Status" column, See below:
              </p>

              <img

                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                You'll see that the DMM at facility 939 accepted 20 EA units.
                Awesome, the DMM has accepted your request and now you can
                physically ship them the accepted inventory. After you have
                physically shipped the inventory out of your facility to the
                destination, then you can click the Finalize Button to have the
                changes reflected throughout the application.
              </p>

              <h5>Conclusion</h5>
              <p>
                Congratulations, you just finalized your first movement plan!
                While the process might seem hard to remember at first, after
                completing several plans it should become very intuitive.
              </p>
