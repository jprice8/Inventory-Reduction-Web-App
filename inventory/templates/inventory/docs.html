            <div id="auth">
              <h3 class="mt-4">Step One: Start by Logging In</h3>

              <p class="mt-4" id="view">
                To use the Reduction Toolkit you must first login using your
                username and password. If you are a Director of Materials
                Management (DMM) with BHS, you will be given a username and
                password that will enable you to act on behalf of your facility.
                If you are not a BHS DMM, you can still sign up, however you
                will not have access to the View, Move, and Act pages. As a
                non-BHS DMM you currently only have access to the "Outstanding
                Requests" page but we are working to expand those functions.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Reduction Toolkit is split into four different sections:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Action Profile</li>
                <li>Target Non Intake Items</li>
                <li>Target High Ext Items</li>
                <li>Review Targeted Items</li>
              </ol>

              <p id="actionprofile">
                We will now be taking an in-depth look at each one of these
                sections. Note that you can jump ahead to any section you are
                interested in by clicking the hyperlinks on the left side of the
                documentation.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step Two: View Page -->
            <div>
              <h3 class="mt-4">Step Two: The Action Profile</h3>
              <p class="mt-4">
                After logging in, you will be redirected to the Action Profile
                page. You can think of this page as your HQ for making all
                decisions related to incoming or outgoing inventory. Below
                you'll see a screenshot of an example Action Profile. You will
                notice that the profile consists of a header at the top of the
                screen with several metrics in a list, and two tables below
                that. These features will be explained over the next several
                steps. On the left is the navigation drawer that you can use to
                navigate the website. Remember that you can always get back to
                the documentation by clicking the tab labeled "Documentation" if
                you are ever stuck or confused.
              </p>

              <p>
                NOTE: Portions of screengrabs in the documentation have been
                redacted to protect sensitive company information.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/ActionProfileDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4" id="target">
                Now that your're familiar with the layout of the website, it's
                time to focus on targeting items for reduction. The Reduction
                Toolkit (RT) takes your inventory counts submitted bi-annually
                and pulls the items located in your Surgery and Cath Lab (SLB
                and NCB are solely items located in surgery). These items are
                then
                <b>sorted for highest Extended Cost (LUOM Price * Quantity)</b>
                and then seperated into two buckets.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Top 100 Items by Ext Cost that <b>did not</b> receive intake in FY2020</li>
                <li>Top 100 Items by Ext Cost that <b>did</b> receive intake in FY2020</li>
              </ul>

              <p id="targetitems">
                Therefore you have two options when targeting items that you'd
                like to reduce. You can target "No Intake Items" or you can
                target "High Ext Items" (AKA items that are seeing intake but we
                might consider being held in excess). Your first priority should
                be to target and reduce inventory that is not seeing intake, so
                let's do that in the next step.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step Three: Target No Intake -->
            <div>
              <h3 class="mt-4">Step Three: Target Items for Reduction</h3>

              <p class="mt-4">
                Still on the Action Profile page, you can navigate to the Target
                No Intake page by clicking the tab on the navigation sidedrawer
                labeled "Target No Intake". This will take you to a screen with
                a list of items being considered "Non-Intake" items. The list
                consists of 100 items that are flagged as no intake and are
                sorted by highest extended cost. In order for an item to be
                considered to have no intake it must meet the following
                requirements:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Zero purchase orders (POs) for FY2020 (source data from Novus
                  Reach)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Zero items issued to your facility (issues) for FY2020 (I9000
                  report from IMMS)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Note that if an item is in multiple locations or "bins" in your
                facility, then the system will group them together if their unit
                of measures (UOM) are the same. This helps to handle items with
                the same IMMS number that are listed multiple times on your
                count sheet.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/NoIntakeItemsDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Now that you've got your list of items with no intake, you can
                begin targeting them. Each DMM should go through their list and
                check to see if any of the items in the list can be reduced at
                their facility. For our example, let's say that you are checking
                the list and see that the item in the screenshot above labeled
                "SLING, URETHRAL DESARA BLUE..." can be reduced. You would then
                click the checkbox in the item's card labeled "Target Item".
                After checking the box, the box will have a blue checkmark in it
                and the system will update automatically. We don't have to click
                anything after checking the box, the system saves automatically
                and we can continue on in the process.
              </p>

              <p id="reviewtargets">
                After going through the list and selecting all of the items that
                you'd would like to reduce from your facility, you can then
                click on the tab labeled "Review Targets" in your navigation
                sidedrawer on the left of your page.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step Four: Review Targets -->
            <div>
              <h3 class="mt-4">Step Four: Review Targets</h3>
              <p>
                After clicking on the "Review Targets" tab, you should now be
                looking at a page with the title "Review Target Items" at the
                top of screen. See below:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/ReviewTargetItemsDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                You'll see the item that you targeted previously, as well as any
                other items that you have targeted.
              </p>

              <p>
                When you want to reduce an item, you will need to submit what is
                called a "movement plan". A movement plan will help you keep
                track of an item during the reduction process and also measure
                how much inventory you have reduced over a given period.
              </p>

              <p>
                To submit a movement plan, click the blue button labeled "Set
                Movement Plan" on the bottom of the item's card.
              </p>

              <p>
                You will now be taken to the page where you can submit your
                movement plan. You'll see three sections of information on this
                page:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Item Information</li>
                <li>BHS Intake and Inventory History</li>
                <li>Tenet Purchase Order History</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The first section under the title "Set Movement Plan for Item:"
                is listing out the pertinent information for the item you have
                selected. Which will include Mfr Cat No, IMMS #, and unit of
                measure information.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/SetMovementPlanDocs1.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                The second section is under the title "BHS Facilities Showing
                Inventory History or Intake History". It's listing facilities
                within Baptist Health System that have shown the selected item
                in their most recent submitted inventory count. Note that even
                if the facility had zero units in their inventory, they will
                still show up if they've had the imms number in their count at
                some point, as we can see with facility 939 (BMC). Also worth
                noting, all measures mentioned above are shown in their lowest
                unit of measure. You can confirm this by referencing the UOM
                information given at the top of this page.
              </p>

              <p>
                The third section is under the label "Tenet Facilities Showing
                Purchase Order History" (pictured below). This section will show
                you if any facilities within Tenet have a made purchase order
                for the selected item in FY2020. In our example, you can see
                that the system is not able to find any matches for Tenet
                facilities and is informing us of that. It is worth noting that
                all markets in Tenet are represented except for the Detroit
                Market. We are still working on integrating their Lawson system
                with IMMS.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/SetMovementPlanDocs2.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Finally, we arrive to the bottom of the page, the Movement Plan
                (pictured above). You should see a form with three fields:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Quantity</li>
                <li>Decision</li>
                <li>System Destination Facility</li>
              </ol>

              <h5>Quantity</h5>
              <p>
                The quantity field is asking how many units of the selected item
                you are seeking to reduce from your quantity. Again, these units
                are in lowest unit of measure. You will be required to enter an
                intenger into this field that is higher than 0 and lower than
                your current inventory quantity which is listed in the item
                information at the top of the page. If you accidentally enter a
                quantity greater than your inventory level you will be shown an
                error page that will instruct you to try again or reference the
                documentation. Note that the Reduction Toolkit lets you set
                multiple Movement Plans on a single item. In order to prevent
                users from overdrafting their stocked inventory, the application
                will throw the aforementioned error page if a user makes
                multiple requests whose cumulative quantity is greater than
                facilities' inventory.
              </p>

              <h5>Decision</h5>
              <p>
                The decision is which method you would like to use to reduce the
                item's inventory. You have four options to choose from and they
                are listed in descending order of most optimal outcome to least
                optimal outcome:
              </p>

              <p><b>Ship to a facility within the system</b></p>
              <p class="ml-4">
                Choose this option if there is a BHS facility that is showing
                large intake of the selected item. This should be your first
                priority if possible.
              </p>

              <p><b>Ship to a Tenet Facility</b></p>
              <p class="ml-4">
                Choose this option if there is a Tenet facility that is showing
                large intake of the selected item. This should be your second
                priority if possible.
              </p>

              <p><b>Sell to a Third Party Vendor</b></p>
              <p class="ml-4">
                Choose this option if there is not enough intake in any BHS
                facilities or Tenet facilities. This should be your third
                choice.
              </p>

              <p><b>Discard the Item</b></p>
              <p class="ml-4">
                Choose this option if you have exhausted all other options. This
                should be your last resort.
              </p>

              <h5>System Destination Facility</h5>
              <p>
                After making a decision, the final field will be system
                destination facility. This field is potentially tricky and may
                lead to errors if not handled correctly. Its purpose is to help
                facilitate transfers within the Baptist Health System by
                declaring which facility you are attempting to transfer to. For
                example, our item is showing no intake in BHS. However, let's
                say NCB was showing a large amount of issued units in 2020, then
                we would click the drop down and select North Central Baptist
                Hospital. But what if you are not shipping the item within BHS
                you might ask? Because this field cannot be left blank we need
                to indicate that we are not shipping within the system and are
                either shipping to a Tenet facility or selling/discarding the
                item. We can do this by clicking the dropdown and selecting
                "Shipping to a Tenet Facility" if we are sending to a Tenet
                facility or we can select "Selling or Discarding" if we are
                selling the item or discarding it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you have filled out all the fields you can press the blue
                button labeled "Submit" to submit the form. For our example,
                let's say that you want to sell 5 EA of this item. To do so, you
                would enter 5 in the quantity field, select the radio button
                labeled "Sell to a third party vendor" and the select "Selling
                or Discarding" in the System Destination Facility dropdown. You
                can then click the submit button to submit the form.
              </p>

              <img

                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Once you've submitted the form, you will taken back to the
                review targets page. You'll now be able to see that there is a
                "1" next to section of the card labeled "Plans Set".
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/PostSubmitTargetDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p id="movementplans" class="mt-4">
                Remember that you can set multiple movement plans on a single
                item. The "Plans Set" counter you can see on the card will help
                you see how many plans you have submitted for a single item.
                Even better, you can click on the gray "See All Plans" button on
                the bottom of the item card to get a detailed breakout of each
                movement plan you have submitted for that item.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the next section, let's talk more about movement plans and
                what we can do with them after creating them.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step Five: Movement Plans -->
            <div>
              <h3 class="mt-4">Step Five: Movement Plans</h3>

              <p>
                Now that you've created your first movement plan, let's look
                more at how we can manage them in the Action Profile page. Click
                the tab labeled "Action Profile" in the navigation sidedrawer to
                be taken to your profile.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first thing you'll notice is that two parts of the profile
                have changed:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/UpdatedActionProfileDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                First, you'll see that in the upper righthand side of the page,
                the metric labeled "You have targeted $_____ of inventory" has
                updated to reflect the new item that you just targeted. The
                metric is blue because it also serves as a link which you can
                click on to get a detailed breakout of the items that you have
                targeted.
              </p>

              <h5>Editing Movement Plans</h5>
              <p>
                Second, you'll notice that there is a new movement plan in your
                table at the bottom of the screen labeled "My Outgoing
                Requests". This is the movement plan you just submitted to
                reduce by selling 5 EA units. If you need to change the amount
                you'd like to reduce then you can do so by clicking the yellow
                button with the pencil icon on the righthand side of the page.
                If you need to change your decision to sell the item to
                discarding or transfering it instead, you will need to delete
                the item by clicking the red trashcan icon and submitting a new
                plan.
              </p>

              <h5>Finalizing Movement Plans</h5>
              <p>
                You'll notice that the status associated with this plan is
                currently "outstanding". Plans that are transfers to Tenet
                facilities, selling or discarding, will be considered
                "outstanding" until you finalize them by clicking the button
                labeled "Finalize".
                <mark
                  >It is important to note that you should not finalize the
                  movement plan until you have physically removed the item from
                  your facility.</mark
                >
                In our example, this would look like reaching out to a third
                party vendor, receiving a quote, receiving approval from your
                CFO, and then physically shipping the item to the third party
                vendor. Once that has been accomplished you will click the
                Finalize button to indicate that you have completed the
                reduction of the item.
              </p>

              <p>
                After finalizing the movement plan, you will notice several
                things happen:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/FinalizedActionProfileDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                First of all, you can see that you no longer have that item
                queued up in your "Outgoing Requests" table. Second, you will
                see that the item was removed from your targeted metric in the
                top righthand side of the page. The ext cost was removed and was
                added to the metric labeled "You have removed $____ of
                inventory". Notice that this metric also allows you to click on
                it and be shown a breakout of the items that are making up your
                completed movement plans. After clicking on the metric you will
                also notice that you can export the table of completed plans out
                to an Excel Spreadsheet. This should be helpful in notifiying
                accounting of the changes that you have made.
              </p>

              <p>
                That's not the only place the application is updating after
                completing a movement plan. By clicking on the "Review Targets"
                tab in the navigation sidedrawer you will see that the field
                labeled "Remaining Quantity" in the item card has been reduced
                by 5 EA units.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/UpdatedReviewTargetItemsDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"

              />

              <h5 class="mt-4">
                Hiding a Targeted Item When You are Done With It
              </h5>
              <p>
                The entire application has updated to reflect your changes. You
                are free to set as many movement plans and reductions on
                inventory as you'd like. When you are satisfied with the level
                of inventory that the item is now set at, you can hide an item
                from your "Review Targets" list by clicking the blue "X" in the
                top righthand side of the item's card. This will help you keep
                your targeted items list from getting cluttered with items that
                you are through targeting. It will also help you work through
                your "No Intake" and "High Ext" lists while keeping things nice
                and organized.
              </p>

              <h5>Conclusion</h5>
              <p id="bhsmovementplans">
                That brings the current tutorial to a close. That is essentially
                everything you would need to know for targeting an item, setting
                a movement plan, and finalizing it once you have completed the
                reduction. One last thing I would like to cover though is how
                transfers work within the Baptist Health System. We've covered
                reduction through transfers to Tenet facilities, selling, and
                discarding items, but now I'd like to focus on transferring an
                item from one facility within BHS to another. These movement
                plans work slightly different than movement plans that are
                directed towards Tenet facilities or selling/discarding. The
                reason they are different is they allow one DMM to respond to a
                movement plan set by another. Let's take a deeper look into how
                that might work.

              <h3>Step Six: Transferring Items within BHS</h3>

              <p class="mt-4">
                Let's look at another example, but this time let's target a
                "High Ext" item instead of a "No Intake" item and also transfer
                it within BHS instead of selling it to a third party vendor.
              </p>

              <p>
                The process for targeting high ext items is relatively the same
                as it is for targeting no intake items. You begin by clicking
                the tab in the navigation sidedrawer labeled "Target High Ext".
                This will take you to the following page:
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that your item cards will have a slightly different format
                than the provided screenshots as sensitive pricing information
                has been redacted.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/TargetHighExtDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Here you'll see a list of item cards that are very similar to
                the ones we saw in the "Target No Intake" list. That's because
                they essentially function in the same way as each other, only
                they show items based on different filters. While the No Intake
                List had requirements of no purchase orders or issues in FY2020,
                the High Intake List has the following requirements for items:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The item must be located in the facilities' Surgery or Cath
                  Lab department
                </li>
                <li>
                  The item must have shown at least one purchase order or one
                  issue in FY2020
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The items that meet that criteria are then sorted from highest
                extended cost to lowest and then filtered down to the top 100
                items.
              </p>

              <p>
                For our example, let's say that you want to reduce the item with
                description, "CATHETER, ABLATION SF SMARTTOUCH CARTO BID TC
                D-F". You'll target the item by checking the box labeled "Target
                Item" at the bottom of the item card. After doing this, you will
                click the tab in the navigation sidedrawer labeled "Review
                Targets" to see the item you just targeted.
              </p>

              <h5>Set the Movement Plan</h5>
              <p>
                Once on the "Review Targets" page, click the blue button labeled
                "Set Movement Plan" on the catheter item you just targeted. You
                will then be taken to the set movement plan form.
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/ReviewTargetItemsHighExtDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                You will then be taken the movement plan form where you will
                make your decision on how you want to reduce these catheters. If
                we pretend that you are the DMM at facility 968, we can see that
                there is quite a lot of movement at your facility for this item
                so we might not want to actually reduce it. But for the sake of
                the example lets say that you would like to reduce it and now
                need to figure out what method you are going to use. You can see
                that below facility 968, facility 939 was issued 4 EA of this
                item in FY2020.
              </p>

              <p>
                So you can see that there is a little movement within BHS,
                however, you look below facility 939 and see that the Abrazo
                Heart Hospital purchased over 600 EA of this item in FY2020.
                Wow, that's a lot of catheters! Therefore it might be a good
                idea to split this reduction plan into two. Because we have a
                priority to cover our own facilities within BHS first, let's try
                and send 4 EA to facility 939 and 5 EA to the heart hospital in
                Phoenix, while keeping 2 EA for a safety stock at our own
                facility. (4 + 5 + 2 = 11 <- our quantity)
              </p>

              <img

                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                In order to make these two movement plans you'll need to submit
                two forms. The first one should look like this:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/BMCMovementFormDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                Here you are sending a request to the DMM at Baptist Medical
                Center (facility 939) that you would like to send them 4 EA of
                the catheters. Click submit to send the form and be taken back
                to the review targets page.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you fill out the second form the Abrazo Heart Hospital, it
                should look like this:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/AbrazoMovementFormDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                After submitting the second form, you will see that on your
                "Review Targets" page the field labeled "Plans Set" will now
                show "2" and if you click the gray "See All Plans" button you
                will be able to see both plans that you just set.
              </p>

              <p class="mt-4">
                You can see that your two movement plans are recorded here and
                are ready to move on to the next step. Click the tab labeled
                "Action Profile" on the navigation sidedrawer to be taken back
                to your profile.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once on your Action Profile page, you will see the two new
                movement plans under your table labeled "My Outgoing Requests".
                See below:
              </p>

              <h5 class="mt-4">Responding to BHS System Requests</h5>
              <p>
                The two requests are still waiting to be finalized. The movement
                plan to the Abrazo Heart Hospital is waiting for you reach out
                to the DMM there, confirm that they can take on this inventory,
                and physically ship the items to that facility. Once this is
                accomplished you will click the Finalize Button and the
                application will update all of your numbers to reflect the
                successful reduction.
              </p>

              <p>
                As mentioned before, the movement plan to facility 939 will work
                slightly different because it is a movement plan within the BHS
                system. If you were to try and click that movement plan's
                Finalize Button right now, it would not work because the
                movement request still has a status of "outstanding".
                <mark>
                  You will not be able to finalize a BHS system movement plan
                  until the DMM of that facility approves your request.
                </mark>
                If you were to look at the Action Profile of the DMM at facility
                939, their table labeled "My Incoming Requests" would look like
                this:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/MyIncomingRequestsDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                You'll see that your request has populated their table and is
                waiting for their respone. They have two options they can choose
                from in order to respond, "Approve" or "Reject", and these are
                chosen by picking their respective buttons on the righthand side
                of the movement plan. If the DMM at facility 939 decides to
                accept the movement plan, they will need to enter the number of
                units into the field labeled "Accept Qty". Note that this figure
                will be in lowest unit of measure already for you.
              </p>

              <p>
                For our example, let's say that the DMM at facility 939 decides
                that they can take on only 2 units instead of the full four.
                They would then enter four in the "Accept Qty" field and would
                then press the green "Accept" button. You may be expecting the
                metric in the top righthand side of the page labeled "You have
                accepted $___ of inventory" to update and reflect the inventory
                that the DMM has just accepted, but that will not happen. This
                movement plan still needs to be finalized by the sending DMM for
                up to be recognized by the application. Let's do that next
              </p>

              <h5>Finalizing the Movement Plan</h5>
              <p>
                Back on the Action Profile for the sending DMM at facility 968,
                you can see that the DMM at facility 939 accepted the movement
                plan you sent them. See below:
              </p>

              <img
                src="https://d3epl9dvc9angi.cloudfront.net/Accepted939RequestDocs.png"
                alt="view page screen grab"
                width="100%"
                class="mt-2 shadow"
              />

              <p class="mt-4">
                You'll see that the DMM at facility 939 accepted 2 EA catheters.
                Awesome, the DMM has accepted your request and now you can
                physically ship them the accepted inventory. After you have
                physically shipped the inventory out of your facility to the
                destination, then you can click the Finalize Button to have the
                changes reflected throughout the application.
              </p>

              <h5>Conclusion</h5>
